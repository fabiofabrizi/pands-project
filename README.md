## About The Project

This is the project for the Programming and Scripting module - Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.
Fisher's Iris Data set is to be researched, and documentation (my opinions) and code (Python) must be produced.


## Getting Started

I started by creating the Github repository 'pands-project' and added the data set to it converted from a data file.
The script for conversion is included

## Why

The task, as I understand it, is to take some data - in this case, about Irises
and interpret it in such a way that:
1) I learn why the data is collected in the first place
2) I can then explain to others, whether they have an interest (or not) how to 
identify what type of Iris they have.

## Background
I have no background in horticulture - the furthest my expertise extends to is mowing the grass and a small herb garden.
However, from looking at the many blogs/articles written on Fisher's Iris data set, the common theme amongst all of them is:
[1] A dataset
[2] Python script(s) to analyse that dataset in order to make sense of the data and/or identify any patterns.

## Research

The various sources/sites/etc that I found and used are listed below.

[1] The Mother
I have no background in horticulture - the furthest my expertise extends to is mowing the grass and a small herb garden.
However, my mother is a keen gardener, she told me about a scenario that occurs fairly often with her.
1) She wants to find out what type of plant/tree/flower/etc she's come across
2) She takes a picture and some measurements and any other relevant information (acidity of soil, type of shade, etc.)
3) She then emails RHS (Royal Horticultural Society - she lives in the UK)
4) Within a few days, someone has responded with the answer. 

So there's a concrete example of a data set point being checked against the data set (or many) in order to produce an answer.
